# Deploying to Vercel

This demo is configured to use NextAuth for authentication. A Credentials provider using [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv) is provided by default, but other
NextAuth providers can be used as well other auth solutions.

### Setting up Vercel KV

1. Create a Vercel account and visit the Storage [tab](https://vercel.com/dashboard/stores) in the dashboard.
2. Click Create and select the KV (Durable Redis) option.
3. Give the KV database a name, select the nearest region and click Create.
4. In Quickstart, click `.env.local` and Copy Snippet to get the connection details (save these for later).

### Creating a new authorized user

1. Run `yarn setup:users` to start creating a new user. The user will be stored in the KV database. The first time this command is run, it will prompt for the KV connection details from the previous step (`KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`). It will also prompt for the Credentials key in Redis where user information is stored. The default value is `tinacms_users`.
2. Once the connection information is complete, the script will query for existing users and print "No users found!" if this is the first time running the script. Next you will be prompted to enter the username, email and password for the user.
3. If successful, the script will print out a message confirming user creation.

### Deploying the project in Vercel

1. Create a new project in Vercel and select this Git repository.
2. In the Environment Variables section, you can copy and paste your entire `.env` file into the first input.
3. Click Deploy and wait for the project to build.
4. Visit the project URL and navigate to `/admin/index.html` to log in. Use the username and password you created in the previous step.

```env

`MONGODB_URI` is the connection string to your MongoDB database. You can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to get a free database.
`TINA_PUBLIC_IS_LOCAL` is a flag that tells Tina to use the local filesystem as the backend.
`NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID` (_optional_ for using Tina Cloud for auth) is the client id for your Tina Cloud application. You can create a Tina Cloud application [here](https://app.tina.io/projects/choose).

# _optionally_ Use Tina Cloud for user authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID=***
